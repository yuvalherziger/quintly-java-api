## What's quintly?
[quintly](https://www.quintly.com) is a _Professional Social Media Analytics_ platform that allows you to track, benchmark and optimize your social media performance. One of the services that quintly offers is its API, which acts as the gateway to **all** of the available metrics through quintly's tool.
 
quintly allows you to track profiles on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, Google+, Pinterest as well as RSS feeds. That includes both publicly available statistics and private-level statistics such as Facebook Insights, Facebook Ads, Instagram Insights, YouTube Analytics and Twitter Analytics.
 
## Getting started

### Build
To build the project from gradle wrapper, run:
```bash
~ ./gradlew build
```
Otherwise, from a [global gradle installation](https://gradle.org/install/):
```bash
~ gradle build
```

### Tests
```bash
~ ./gradlew test # or 'gradle test' with a global gradle installation
```

### Examples:

#### List-Profiles endpoint:
The **List-Profiles** endpoint is perhaps the simplest and most useful endpoint for a quick start with the quintly API.
The response of this endpoint is a list of all the social media profiles under your quintly account. The endpoint can also be narrowed down to a specific group ID within the account.
  
```java
import com.quintly.api.endpoint.ListProfiles;
import com.quintly.api.entity.Profile;
import com.quintly.api.exception.*;
import com.quintly.api.factory.ClientFactory;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.ArrayList;
 
class MyApp {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, IncompatibleGetterException, BadResponseException {
        
        ArrayList<Profile> profiles = ClientFactory.createClient()
                .executeGet(
                        new Credentials(1, "client-secret"),
                        new ListProfiles() // or 'new ListProfiles(10)' for a specific group ID
                ).getProfilesCollection().getData();
        
        // Dig in:
        for (Profile profile : profiles) {
            System.out.println(profile.getName());
            System.out.println(profile.getPlatformType());
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

#### Custom Response Model:
The thing that makes the QQL endpoint of quintly's API different from its other endpoints is that the response's structure is a direct derivative of the metric or QQL query that's requested, thus it's not predictable. For that reason, the library does not implement a specific QQL response format.
The following QQL query is a legitimate query, where the `profileId`, `time` and `fans` data points are selected from the `Facebook` data source (but one could also apply column aliases and change the attribute names in the response):

```sql
SELECT profileId, time, fans FROM facebook
```

The response from the API would be along the following lines:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": [{
            "profileId": 123,
            "time": "2017-11-29 00:00:00",
            "fans": 1947182
        },
        {
            "profileId": 123,
            "time": "2017-11-30 00:00:00",
            "fans": 1947310
        }
    ]
}
```

The library allows you to pass down your custom response model, to create a clear interface between the raw response and your application's models.
Let's implement the following two classes, the first one for a single data node and the second one for the upper level response:

```java
package com.domain.myapp;

public class MyCustomNode {
    private int profileId;
    private String time;
    private int fans;
    public int getProfileId()   { return profileId; }
    public String getTime()     { return time;      }
    public int getFans()        { return fans;      }
}
```
 
 ```java
package com.domain.myapp; 
import java.util.ArrayList;
 
public class MyCustomResponseModel {
    private boolean success;
    private ArrayList<MyCustomNode> data;
 
    public boolean isSuccess() {
        return success;
    }
 
    public ArrayList<MyCustomNode> getData() {
        return data;
    }
 }
```

Now, all that's left to do is to use the library's custom parser and pass down your custom model, like so:

```java
import com.quintly.api.endpoint.Qql;
import com.quintly.api.exception.BadResponseException;
import com.quintly.api.factory.ClientFactory;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.List;
 
class MyApp {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, BadResponseException {
        // create a list of the profiles we want to fetch from the api in the above metric:
        List<Integer> profileIds = new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(123));
        // Submit the request:
        MyCustomResponseModel myCustomResponseModel = (MyCustomResponseModel) ClientFactory.createClient()
                .executeGet(
                        new Credentials(1, "client-secret"),
                        new Qql(
                                new Date(1506816000000L),
                                new Date(),
                                profileIds,
                                "SELECT profileId, time, fans FROM facebook"
                        )
                ).getData(new ModelParser<>(MyCustomResponseModel.class));
        // Dig in:
        for (MyCustomNode dataNode : myCustomResponseModel.getData()) {
            System.out.println(dataNode.getTime());
            System.out.println(dataNode.getFans());
        }
    }
}
```

## What's next?

- `config.yml.dist` and allow loading configurations from a resource
- Add examples package
- More exception types
